    <h1>Blackhole</h1>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>

    <p>This page is just as a description of that infrastructure.</p>

    <h3>NODEMASTER (FRA)</h3>
    <p>This machine is a BGP router running Debian and hosted in Germany by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ifog.ch/de">iFog Gmbh</a>.</p>
    <p>It also has WireGuard running on it to provide connectivity to my personal computers and phones to internal services.</p>
